## Example Support Request

**Good Example:**

Subject: Cannot upload invoices via AI parsing

Description: I'm unable to upload invoices through the AI data extraction feature. When I click "Upload Invoice" in the Bills section and select a PDF, the system shows an error "Invalid file format" even though the file is a valid PDF exported from Acme Corp.

Steps to reproduce:
1. Go to Bills > Upload Invoice
2. Select PDF file (test-invoice.pdf)
3. Click "Upload"
4. Error appears

Error message: "Invalid file format - Expected PDF received unknown"

This started today. I was able to upload invoices normally yesterday. I'm on Windows 10 using Chrome browser.

Impact: I have about 20 invoices to process today and cannot upload them. I'm currently manually entering the data which is taking significant time.

Browser: Chrome 123.0
OS: Windows 10

**Poor Example:**

Subject: Something's broken

Description: The upload thing doesn't work. I tried uploading stuff and it gave an error. Please fix this. My password is MyPassword123 if you need to test my account.
