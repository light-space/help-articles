## Understanding Light Cards

Light cards are:

- **Physical Cards**: Issued to employees for in-person and online purchases
- **Virtual Cards**: Single-use card numbers for online vendors
- **Instant Load**: Funds available immediately after loading
- **Spend Control**: Limits can be set per card or per employee
- **Auto-Reconciliation**: Card transactions automatically feed to expense module

Light partners with card providers to issue cards and process transactions.

## Card Types

**Physical Card**:
- Credit card style (Visa or Mastercard)
- Issued in employee's name
- Can be used in stores, online, ATM

- Ideal for high-risk or one-time purchases

**Commercial Card**:

## KYC Verification Process

Before issuing a card, Light must verify the employee:

### Step 1: Employee Information Collection

1. Employee opens Light app or portal
2. Navigates to **Cards** > **Request Card**
3. Provides information:
   - **Full Legal Name**: As it appears on ID
   - **Date of Birth**: Required for verification
   - **Social Security Number** (US) or equivalent: For identity verification
   - **Home Address**: Current residential address
   - **Phone Number**: For verification calls
   - **Employment Status**: Full-time, contractor, etc.

4. Click **Continue**

### Step 2: Identity Verification

Light verifies identity through:

**Option 1: Automated Verification**
1. Light checks against databases (credit bureaus, ID verification services)
2. Typically instant or within 1 hour
3. Light notifies employee: "Verified" or "Manual review needed"

**Option 2: Manual Verification**
1. If automated verification fails or uncertain
2. Light sends request for document upload:
   - **Government ID**: Driver's license, passport, national ID
   - **Proof of Address**: Utility bill, bank statement, lease agreement

3. Employee uploads documents
4. Light compliance team reviews (typically 24-48 hours)
5. Approved or additional information requested

### Step 3: Company Information

1. Light collects **company details**:
   - Company legal name
   - Company address
   - Tax ID / EIN
   - Industry type

2. Light verifies company is legitimate
3. Typically instant

### Step 4: Beneficial Ownership (If Applicable)

For larger organizations:

1. Light may request **beneficial ownership** information
2. Who are the actual owners of the company
3. Required for AML (Anti-Money Laundering) compliance
4. Already available if company incorporated

### Step 5: Approval and Card Issuance

1. Once KYC approved:
   - Employee receives notification: "Your card has been approved"
   - Card is shipped (physical card: 5-7 business days)
   - Virtual card available immediately

2. Card arrives with:
   - PIN (mailed separately for security)

   - Usage guidelines

3. Employee activates card in app:
   - Confirm receipt
   - Set PIN (physical card)
   - Review limits and settings

## KYC Compliance

Light must comply with regulations:

**Bank Secrecy Act**: Verify customer identity
**USA PATRIOT Act**: Check against OFAC lists (sanctions)
