## Getting Started with Mobile

### Downloading the App

1. Open Apple App Store or Google Play Store

## Capturing a Receipt

### Using In-App Camera

1. Open Light app
2. Tap **Submit Expense** or **+** icon
3. Choose **Take Photo**
4. Phone camera opens with guidance:
   - **Focus box**: Center receipt in this box
   - **Lighting indicator**: Shows if lighting is good

5. Frame receipt and tap **Capture**
6. Photo preview shows
7. Tap **Use This Photo** to proceed (or **Retake** for better photo)

> Tip: Use Light's in-app camera instead of native camera. Light includes guidance and preprocessing for better extraction.

### Uploading from Library

Use existing receipt photos:

1. Tap **Submit Expense**
2. Choose **Upload from Library**
3. Browse to receipt photo
4. Select and tap **Use**
5. Photo is loaded and processed

Good for receipts photographed earlier or forwarded by others.

## AI Receipt Extraction on Mobile

After capturing or uploading, Light processes on device:

1. Light analyzes photo locally (on your phone) for privacy
2. Takes 3-10 seconds depending on image complexity
3. Shows progress indicator: "Analyzing receipt..."
4. When complete, shows **Extraction Preview**:
   - **Merchant**: Shop or restaurant name
   - **Amount**: Total cost
   - **Date**: Purchase date
   - **Items**: What was purchased (if visible)

5. Buttons: **Looks Good** or **Edit Details**

### Low-Quality Detection

If photo quality is poor:

1. Light indicates: "Receipt is hard to read. Better photo?"
2. Options:
   - **Retake**: Take better photo
   - **Manual Entry**: Type details yourself
   - **Use Anyway**: Proceed with low-confidence extraction

3. Choose option

Retaking usually improves accuracy significantly.

## Photo Tips for Best Results

### Lighting

- **Natural light**: Best (avoid shadows)
- **Bright area**: Indoors or outdoors in daylight
- **Avoid glare**: Angle receipt to avoid phone flash reflection

### Receipt Position

- **Centered**: Receipt in center of frame
- **Straight**: Not at an angle
- **Full receipt**: Entire receipt visible, nothing cropped
- **Close-up**: Receipt fills most of frame, but not cut off

### Phone Technique

- **Steady hand**: Use both hands or lean phone against something
- **Focus**: Wait for auto-focus to lock (usually 1-2 seconds)
- **Distance**: 6-12 inches from receipt (test to find sweet spot)

Light's in-app guidance shows examples of good/bad positions.

## Batch Submission

Submit multiple receipts quickly:

3. Capture first receipt, confirm details, tap **Submit**

Submitting multiple in quick succession is efficient while traveling.
