## Tips for success

**Start with core functionality first.** Get invoicing, AP, and bank reconciliation working before adding advanced features like revenue recognition or multi-entity consolidation.

**Involve your team early.** Have each team member complete onboarding in their role so they understand their responsibilities in Light workflows.

**Use defaults intelligently.** Light comes with sensible defaults for most configurations. Don't customize everything—focus on what's unique to your business.

**Test thoroughly.** Spend time in a test environment (or with test data) before going live. Test approval workflows, notifications, and edge cases.

**Get admin training.** Ensure your Finance Admin understands settings, user management, and troubleshooting. They'll be your primary internal resource.

**Start small, expand gradually.** You don't need every feature on day one. Implement core AR, AP, and expense workflows first, then add bank reconciliation and advanced features.

## Estimated timeline

For a typical mid-market organization:
- **Weeks 1-2:** Account setup, organization configuration, team onboarding
- **Weeks 2-3:** Bank and integration connectivity, workflow configuration
- **Week 3-4:** Testing and refinement
- **Week 4:** Go-live

For larger organizations with complex requirements:
- Add 2-4 weeks for data migration and legacy system integration
- Add 1-2 weeks for custom role and workflow configuration

For simple organizations or startups:
- Reduce to 1-2 weeks total with focused setup
