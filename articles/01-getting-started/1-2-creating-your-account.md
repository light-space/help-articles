# Creating your account

This article guides you through signing up for Light and completing your initial profile setup. Once you're done, you'll be ready to configure your organization and start using Light.

[Open in Light →](https://app.light.inc/dashboard)

## Sign up for Light

1. Visit the Light login page and click **Sign up**
2. Enter your work email address
3. Click **Continue**
4. You'll receive a verification email at the address you provided
5. Click the verification link in your email (or copy the code and paste it into Light)
6. Create a strong password
7. Click **Create account**

Your account is now created and ready to configure.

> **Good to know:** Light uses Auth0 for authentication, which means single sign-on (SSO) integration is available for enterprise accounts. If your company uses Google Workspace, Microsoft 365, or another identity provider, ask your IT admin about SSO setup during onboarding.

## Set up your profile

After verifying your email, you'll be guided through profile setup:

1. **Full name** - Enter your first and last name as you'd like it to appear in Light
2. **Job title** - Enter your role (e.g., "Finance Manager", "CFO", "Operations Lead")
3. **Phone number (optional)** - Provide a contact number for account recovery and team coordination
4. **Time zone** - Select your primary time zone for activity logs and transaction timestamps
5. **Language preference** - Choose your preferred language for the platform interface

Click **Complete setup** when finished. You'll be taken to the onboarding wizard where you'll set up your organization.

## Initial login and security

On your next login:

1. Go to the Light login page and click **Sign in**
2. Enter your email and password
3. If you've set up two-factor authentication (recommended), enter your 2FA code

> **Tip:** We recommend enabling two-factor authentication for additional account security. You can do this in your account settings after your initial setup.

## What's next?

Once your profile is complete, you'll proceed to organization setup. This is where you'll:
- Create your company
- Set up legal entities
- Configure multi-currency support
- Add your first team members

See [Setting up your organization](#) for the next steps.

## Troubleshooting

**Didn't receive a verification email?**
Check your spam folder first. If you still don't see it, click "Resend email" on the signup page.

**Need to change your email address?**
Contact Light support with your account ID. We can help update your primary email before you verify.

**Forgot your password?**
Click "Forgot password" on the login page. Enter your email, verify your identity through the link sent to your inbox, and set a new password.
