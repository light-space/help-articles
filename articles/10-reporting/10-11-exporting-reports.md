# Exporting and Sharing Reports

Financial reports need to be shared with stakeholders: management, investors, auditors, tax authorities, and board members. Light provides export capabilities to help you distribute report data to stakeholders who need it.

## Report export format

Light exports reports in CSV (comma-separated values) format. CSV files contain raw data that can be opened in spreadsheet applications like Excel or Google Sheets, imported into BI tools, or loaded into databases and other systems.

## Exporting a report

To export a report:

1. Navigate to any report in Light
2. Click **Export**
3. Light generates and downloads a CSV file

Your browser downloads the file to your default downloads folder. You can then open the CSV in your preferred spreadsheet application for further formatting, analysis, or sharing.

## Exporting multiple reports

To export several reports:

1. Navigate to **Planning & Reports → Reports**
2. Export each report individually as CSV
3. Combine or organize the CSV files as needed for distribution

## Access control and sharing permissions

Control who can access reports:

1. Generate or open a report
2. Click **Share**
3. Select users or teams to grant access
4. Set permission level:
   - **View**: Read-only access
   - **Edit**: Can view and modify filters/formatting (but not underlying data)
   - **Full**: Can view, modify, and share with others
5. Click **Share**

Light tracks access and restricts based on permissions.

## Shared report library

Create a library of shared reports for your organization:

1. Navigate to **Planning & Reports → Reports**
2. See all reports shared with you
3. Click any report to view or export
4. Search or filter by:
   - Report name
   - Owner (who created/shares the report)
   - Last updated date
   - Report type (balance sheet, custom, etc.)

This creates a central repository reducing duplicate work.

## Formatting exported data

After exporting a CSV file, you can format and present the data as needed:

1. Open the CSV in Excel, Google Sheets, or another spreadsheet application
2. Apply formatting (fonts, colors, borders) for presentation
3. Create charts and visualizations
4. Save as PDF or other formats for distribution to stakeholders

This approach gives you full control over how the final report appears.

## Linking reports in documents

Reference reports in other documents:

1. Export report and save file name
2. In presentations or documents, insert link to report file
3. Recipients can click to view/download

This is useful when multiple reports support a decision or analysis.

## Comparison reports for presentations

When presenting variances or trends:

1. Create custom report showing budget vs. actual with variance %
2. Export to CSV
3. Open in a spreadsheet application to highlight significant variances
4. Create charts for presentation deck
5. Reference supporting report for detail

This provides both high-level visual summary and supporting detail.

## Report archiving

Maintain archive of historical reports:

1. Export reports for each period (monthly, quarterly, annual)
2. Name by period (e.g., "P&L_2025_January", "Balance Sheet_2024_Year End")
3. Store in shared folder or Light's document repository
4. Allows comparison to historical periods

Archiving supports audit procedures and trend analysis.

## Financial statement presentation

Format financial statements for presentation or SEC filing:

1. Export balance sheet, P&L, and cash flow reports as CSV
2. Open in a spreadsheet application to format:
   - Proper indentation and account classification
   - Subtotals and totals properly labeled
   - Currency clearly indicated
3. Add footnotes and disclosures
4. Save as PDF for submission to regulators or investors

## Auditor data requests

Financial auditors request extensive data. Light simplifies fulfillment:

1. Export the reports auditors need:
   - Trial balance (as-of date)
   - Balance sheet and P&L (date and period)
   - Account detail schedules (major accounts)
   - Reconciliation schedules (AR aging, AP aging, bank rec, fixed assets)
   - Consolidation working papers (if applicable)
2. Export each report as CSV
3. Package and send to audit firm

Auditors receive comprehensive data that can be imported into their analysis tools.

## Real estate and lease data export

For lease accounting or real estate analysis:

1. Create report showing:
   - Lease obligations by property
   - Right-of-use asset detail
   - Lease expense schedule
2. Export to CSV
3. Lease accountant uses for subledger reconciliation

## Budget vs. actual for board presentations

Prepare executive summaries:

1. Create variance report: Budget vs. Actual
2. Filter to show only significant items (>$1M or >10% variance)
3. Export to CSV and format in a spreadsheet application
4. Add explanatory narratives for material variances
5. Save as PDF for board book

This provides governance-level summary without overwhelming detail.

## Customer and vendor reports for stakeholders

Share limited reports with external stakeholders:

1. Create statement showing customer account balance, aging, recent transactions
2. Export to CSV and format in a spreadsheet application
3. Save as PDF and share with customer for their records

Similarly for vendors, showing your outstanding payables.

## Tax compliance reporting

Package tax data for filing or audit:

1. Create tax transaction detail report (by tax code)
2. VAT return supporting documentation
3. Income tax supporting schedules
4. Export each report as CSV
5. Send to tax advisor or file with returns

## Data import to BI and analytics tools

Export data for business intelligence:

1. Create report showing underlying transactions (not summarized)
2. Export as CSV
3. Import to analytics tool (Tableau, Power BI, Looker)
4. Create advanced visualizations and dashboards

This bridges Light's reporting to specialized analytics tools.

## Performance benchmarking

Compare your financial metrics to industry:

1. Extract your financial data as CSV
2. Input industry benchmarks
3. Compare in Excel or BI tool
4. Identify areas for improvement

Light provides the data; external benchmarking sources provide comparison targets.
