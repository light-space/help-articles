# Profit and Loss

The Profit and Loss statement (P&L), also called the Income Statement, measures your company's financial performance over a specific period. It shows revenue earned, expenses incurred, and resulting profit or loss. The P&L is essential for evaluating profitability, identifying cost drivers, and assessing business performance against targets.

## P&L structure

The P&L organizes accounts into sections:

**Revenue** (sales):
- Product revenue: Sales of goods
- Service revenue: Sales of services
- Subscription revenue: Recurring billing
- Other revenue: Licensing, royalties, etc.

Total revenue shows your top-line financial performance.

**Cost of goods sold (COGS)**: Direct costs to produce goods or deliver services:
- Materials
- Labor
- Manufacturing overhead

**Gross profit** = Revenue - COGS. Shows profitability before operating expenses.

**Operating expenses**: Costs to run the business:
- Sales and marketing
- Research and development
- Administrative and general
- Depreciation

**Operating income** = Gross Profit - Operating Expenses. Shows profit from core business operations.

**Other income/expenses**: Non-operating items:
- Interest income or expense
- Gain/loss on asset sales
- Foreign exchange gains/losses

**Profit before tax** = Operating Income + Other Items.

**Tax expense**: Income taxes owed.

**Net profit** = Profit Before Tax - Tax Expense. Bottom-line profitability.

## Accessing the P&L in Light

Generate your P&L statement:

1. Navigate to **Planning & Reports → Reports**
2. Select period (month, quarter, or year)
3. Select entities to include (single entity or consolidated)
4. Select currency (transaction, local, or group)
5. Click **Generate**

Light displays the P&L formatted by revenue, expense, and profit categories.

## Interpreting P&L accounts

**Revenue accounts**: Represent sales of products and services. Show before returns and discounts.

**Discount and returns accounts**: Reduce gross revenue to net revenue (revenue after typical reductions).

**Cost of goods sold**: Direct costs that vary with production or service delivery. Excludes overhead and administrative costs.

**Gross margin** = Gross Profit ÷ Revenue. Percentage of revenue remaining after direct costs. High margins indicate pricing power or efficient operations.

**Operating expenses**: Fixed and variable costs to operate the business. Include all support functions.

**EBITDA** = Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization.

A metric showing operating profitability before financing and tax impacts (calculated as Operating Income + Depreciation + Amortization).

**Interest expense**: Cost of borrowed money. Shows on P&L when debt is outstanding.

**Tax expense**: Income taxes owed based on taxable income. Includes current and deferred tax.

> Good to know: Some companies show tax as a percentage (effective tax rate) as well as absolute amount for stakeholder understanding.

## P&L analysis metrics

Key performance indicators derived from the P&L:

**Gross margin %** = Gross Profit ÷ Revenue

Shows profitability on each sale before operating expenses.

**Operating margin %** = Operating Income ÷ Revenue

Shows profitability from core business operations.

**Net margin %** = Net Income ÷ Revenue

Shows bottom-line profitability. Industry-specific benchmarks exist.

**Operating leverage**: How much expenses increase relative to revenue growth.

Light can calculate these metrics automatically in custom P&L reports.

## Revenue recognition on the P&L

Revenue appears on the P&L in the period it's recognized, which may differ from cash receipt:

- Accrued revenue: Earned but not yet invoiced
- Deferred revenue releases: Invoiced but recognized over future periods
- Sales returns: Reduce revenue in current period

The P&L reflects economic reality (when you earned the revenue) rather than cash timing.

## Expense recognition and matching

Expenses appear on the P&L in the period incurred, which may differ from cash payment:

- Accrued expenses: Incurred but not yet paid
- Depreciation: Systematically allocating asset cost over useful life
- Prepaid expenses: Releasing prepayment as benefit is consumed

This matching principle ensures P&L reflects the cost of earning revenue in each period.

## Multi-period P&L analysis
