# Navigating Light as an Employee

Light's interface is designed to get you where you need to go quickly. Let's walk through the main sections you'll use.

[Open in Light →](https://app.light.inc/dashboard)

## Your Personal Sidebar

When you log into Light, you'll see a sidebar on the left with your main navigation options. Here's what each section does:

**Home (/dashboard)**
Your home page shows you an overview of your activity: recent expenses, pending approvals if you're a manager, upcoming card statements, and quick actions to get started. It's your at-a-glance view of everything happening in your Light account.

**Tasks (/user-tasks)**
This is your to-do list. You'll see expenses waiting for your review (if you manage people), purchase requests that need approval, and any other action items that need your attention. Click on any task to handle it.

**Expenses (/expenses)**
All your submitted expenses live here. You can view the status of each one (Submitted, Approved, Processing, Paid), see details like amount and category, and submit new expenses. This is where you track reimbursements.

**Cards (/user-cards)**
If your company issued you a Light card, you'll manage it here. View your card details, check your balance, see transaction history, freeze or unfreeze your card, and update your card settings.

## Top Bar Features

**Search**
Click the search icon in the top bar to quickly find expenses, cards, team members, or help articles by name or date.

**Notifications**
The bell icon shows you updates on your submitted items: when an expense is approved, when a purchase request needs your attention, or when your reimbursement is being processed. Click it to see your notification history.

**Profile Menu**
Click your profile icon (top right) to access settings, notification preferences, your profile, and to log out.

## Mobile Access

Light works great on mobile too. Open it in your phone's browser, and you'll get a simplified version of the same features. Perfect for submitting an expense on the go with a quick receipt photo.
