# Setting Up Your Profile

Before you start submitting expenses and getting reimbursed, take a few minutes to set up your profile. It only takes a few steps, and it ensures you get paid back smoothly.

> **Note:** To access the reimbursement module, your account must have the **Reimbursement** access role. If you don't see reimbursement options in Light, ask your admin to assign this role to you.

## Adding Your Personal Details

1. Click your profile icon in the top right
2. Select "Profile Settings"
3. Add or update your information:
   - Full name (as it appears on your bank account)
   - Email address
   - Phone number (optional, but helpful for notifications)
   - Job title and department (optional, but helps your managers organize approvals)

Keep your name exactly as it appears on your bank account—this makes sure reimbursements land in the right place.

## Setting Up Your Banking Information

When you submit an expense and it gets approved, Light needs to know where to send your reimbursement. You only have to do this once.

1. In Profile Settings, go to "Banking Information"
2. Enter the following details:
   - **Bank Name** (e.g., "Chase," "Wells Fargo")
   - **Account Holder Name** (must match your legal name)
   - **IBAN** (if your company is outside the US) or **Account Number** (for US banks)
   - **Routing Number** (US banks only)
3. Double-check that everything is correct—Light will use this to deposit your reimbursements
4. Click "Save"

**Security:** Your banking details are encrypted and stored securely and is only used to send you money.

## Notification Preferences

Control how Light contacts you:

1. In Profile Settings, go to "Notifications"
2. Choose how you want to be notified:
   - **Email**: Get updates when your expenses are approved, when you're assigned a task, or when your reimbursement is processed
   - **In-App**: See notifications in Light whenever you log in
   - **Slack/Teams** (if your company connects these): Get alerts directly in Slack or Teams
3. Select which types of updates you care about (e.g., expense approvals, task assignments, payment processed)
4. Save your preferences
