# Capturing Receipts on Mobile

On the road? Light works great on your phone. Snap a photo of your receipt right when you get it, and Light's AI reads it instantly. Here's how.

## Access Light on Mobile

1. Open your phone's web browser (Safari on iPhone, Chrome on Android)
2. Go to **app.light.inc**
3. Log in with your credentials
4. Light will display in a mobile-optimized view

Light doesn't require a separate app—just use your browser. It's responsive and works smoothly on any device.

## Taking a Receipt Photo

**Set yourself up for success:**
- **Good lighting**: Natural light or overhead lighting works best
- **Straight angle**: Hold your phone parallel to the receipt (not at an angle)
- **Full receipt in frame**: Capture the entire receipt—date, merchant, amount, items purchased
- **Close enough to read**: Light needs to see the text clearly, but don't crop anything out
- **Still shot**: Hold steady for a moment before snapping

**Avoid:**
- Receipts in the sun (creates glare)
- Blurry or crooked photos (hard for AI to read)
- Only showing part of the receipt
- Dark lighting that makes text hard to see

## Submitting Your Receipt

1. In Light on your mobile browser, tap **Expenses** in the sidebar
2. Tap **"+ New Expense"** or **"Submit Expense"**
3. Tap the **camera or attachment button**
4. Choose **"Take a Photo"** (to snap one now) or **"Choose from Library"** (to upload a photo you already took)
5. If taking a photo: frame your receipt and tap the shutter button
6. Light's AI reads the receipt and fills in:
   - Merchant name
   - Amount
   - Date
   - Category suggestion

## Review & Edit

1. Look over what Light extracted
2. If something's wrong, tap that field and edit it
3. Add a description if you want (e.g., "Client meeting lunch")
4. Make sure the category is right
5. Tap **"Submit for Approval"**

That's it—your expense is submitted from your phone.

## Quick Tips

- **Submit while the purchase is fresh**: You'll remember details better and be more accurate
- **Batch your receipts**: Save up a few receipts and submit them all at once when you have time
- **Photo library**: If you already took a photo, Light can work with that too—no need to retake it
- **Check the receipt**: Before you submit, make sure Light read everything correctly. It's faster to fix it now than after your manager sees it

## Troubleshooting

**"The photo is too blurry"**
Retake the photo with better lighting and a steadier hand. Make sure the receipt text is clearly visible.

**"Light can't read my receipt"**
Try again with a clearer photo. If it's a digital receipt (email), you can take a screenshot of that instead. Some receipts are just hard to read—you can type in the details manually.

**"I want to edit the details"**
After Light reads the receipt, you can click any field and change it. Amounts, dates, categories—all editable before you submit.

**"My phone went to sleep before I submitted"**
No worries. Light saves your draft. Go back to Expenses and you'll see it waiting for you to finish.

## Mobile Browser Tips

- **Bookmark Light**: Save app.light.inc to your home screen for quick access
- **Allow camera access**: Your browser needs permission to access your camera. When prompted, tap "Allow"
- **Check your internet**: Make sure you have a good connection before submitting
- **Portrait orientation**: Hold your phone in portrait mode for easier viewing and submission
