# Submitting Expenses via Slack

If your company connects Light to Slack, you can submit expenses without ever leaving Slack. It's fast, convenient, and perfect for when you're on the go.

## How It Works

Light's Slack bot makes submitting expenses easy. You just upload a receipt image, and Light's AI does the rest.

## Method 1: Direct Message to @Light

1. Open Slack and search for **@Light** bot (your admin sets this up)
2. Click to start a direct message
3. Click the **"+"** attachment button
4. Upload a photo or image of your receipt
5. Light's AI reads the receipt and replies with the extracted details:
   - Merchant name
   - Amount
   - Date
   - Suggested category
6. Review the details in Slack
7. Click **"Confirm & Submit"** to send it to Light
8. The expense appears in your Light account for approval

## Method 2: Use the /expense Command

1. In any Slack channel or DM, type **/expense**
2. A form will pop up—attach your receipt image
3. Light's AI reads it and shows you the details
4. Confirm or edit the information
5. Click **"Submit"** and your expense is added to Light

## Method 3: Reaction Shortcut

Some companies set up Light so you can:
1. **React to a receipt image** someone posts in Slack with a specific emoji (ask your admin what it is)
2. Light's bot responds and extracts the details
3. Confirm and submit directly in Slack

## After You Submit

Once you hit "Submit" in Slack, your expense shows up in Light's Expenses page right away. It goes into the Submitted status and waits for your manager's approval. You can track it anytime on your Light dashboard.

## Why Use This Method

- **Fast**: No need to switch to the Light app or go to a browser
- **Mobile-friendly**: Works great on your phone while you're traveling
- **All in one place**: Your team communication and expense submission in the same app

## Troubleshooting

**"I don't see @Light in Slack"**
Your admin needs to install the Light Slack app. Ask them to enable it in your Slack workspace.

**"The AI got my receipt wrong"**
You can still edit the details after Light reads it—just fix the fields before you confirm. Or submit it and edit it in Light later before your manager approves it.

**"I submitted the same expense twice"**
Check your Light Expenses page to see if it's there. You can delete the duplicate before it gets approved. If it's already approved, contact your manager or admin.
