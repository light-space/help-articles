# Submitting Expenses via Microsoft Teams

If your company uses Microsoft Teams and has Light connected, you can submit expenses directly from Teams. It's as easy as uploading a receipt image.

## How It Works

Light's Teams bot reads your receipt and extracts all the details automatically. You review them and submit—all without leaving Teams.

## Method 1: Direct Message to Light Bot

1. Open Microsoft Teams and find the **Light** bot in your apps (ask your admin if you don't see it)
2. Click to open a direct message with Light
3. Click the **attachment button** (paperclip icon)
4. Upload a photo or image of your receipt
5. Light's AI reads it and sends back the extracted details:
   - Merchant name
   - Amount
   - Date
   - Suggested category
6. Review the details
7. Click **"Confirm & Submit"** to add it to your Light account
8. Your expense is ready for approval

## Method 2: Use the Light Command

1. In Teams, type **/light** or search for the Light app command
2. A form appears where you can upload your receipt image
3. Light extracts the details and shows them to you
4. Confirm or make edits
5. Click **"Submit"** and the expense goes into Light

## After You Submit

Your expense appears in Light's Expenses page (/expenses) immediately. It's marked as "Submitted" and goes to your manager for approval. Track it anytime on your Light dashboard.

## Why Use This Method

- **Seamless**: No app switching—your communication and expenses are in the same place
- **Quick**: Submit while you're thinking about it, or at the end of the week
- **Accessible**: Works great on Teams mobile app for receipts captured on the go

## Troubleshooting

**"I don't see the Light bot in Teams"**
Your admin needs to install the Light app for Microsoft Teams. Ask them to set it up in your Teams workspace.

**"The receipt details are wrong"**
You can edit them right in Teams before you confirm, or you can submit and fix them in Light before your manager approves.

**"I accidentally submitted an expense"**
Check your Light Expenses page. If it's not approved yet, you can click it and delete it or make changes.
