## Contact your finance team first

Your company's finance or accounting team knows your setup best. They can often answer questions about:

- Company policy and approval workflows
- How expenses should be categorized
- Who to contact for specific issues
- Your company's payment schedule or other processes

Check your internal directory or Slack to find who to reach out to. They're usually happy to help.

## Get instant answers

### In-app chat (AI-powered)

Look for the help icon in the bottom right corner of [app.light.inc](https://app.light.inc). You can type your question and get an instant AI-powered answer. This is the fastest way to find help with common questions about using Light.

### @light in Slack or Microsoft Teams

If your company has connected Light to Slack or Microsoft Teams, you can mention **@light** in any channel or direct message to get instant AI-powered answers — without leaving your communication tool.

## Contact Light support

If you need help from a person — for example, something isn't working and the AI answers aren't solving it — email the Light support team.

**Email:** `support@light.inc`

A support agent will respond to your request.

## What to include in your report

When you email Light support, help us help you faster by including:

- **What you were trying to do** — Be specific ("I tried to upload a receipt for an expense" instead of "upload isn't working")
- **What happened** — Describe the error or unexpected behavior
- **Your email address** — So we can look up your account
- **Screenshots** — If possible, a screenshot of the issue is super helpful
- **Browser and device** — What device and browser are you using? (e.g., "Chrome on Mac" or "Safari on iPhone")
- **When it happened** — Date and time, and whether it's still happening

The more detail you give, the faster we can track down the problem.

## Still having trouble?

If you can't reach your finance team and support is taking longer than expected, try:

- **Clearing your cache** — Sometimes Light works better after a fresh start
- **Using a different browser** — See if the issue happens in Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.
- **Checking your internet connection** — A slow or unstable connection can cause weird behavior
- **Logging out and back in** — A fresh session often clears things up
