# Approving or declining reimbursements

When a team member submits an expense for reimbursement, you might be asked to review and approve it. Here's how to check expenses and decide whether to approve, request changes, or decline.

## Review the expense details

Click on the reimbursement in your Tasks list. You'll see:

- **Employee name** — Who submitted the expense
- **Receipt** — An image or PDF of the receipt
- **Amount** — How much they're asking to be reimbursed
- **Category** — Type of expense (travel, meals, supplies, etc.)
- **Description** — What the expense was for
- **Date** — When the purchase happened

## Check against your expense policy

Before you approve, compare the expense against your company's expense policy. Make sure:

- The expense category is allowed
- The amount is reasonable and within any limits
- The purchase was business-related
- The receipt is clear and shows the date and amount

If your company has specific rules (like a per-meal limit or pre-approval for certain purchases), verify those too.

## Approve the expense

If everything checks out, click **Approve**. The employee will be notified and the reimbursement will be processed according to your company's schedule.

## Request changes

If the expense is close to approval but something's off, you can click **Request Changes** instead of outright declining. Add a comment explaining what you need (a clearer receipt, clarification on the business purpose, etc.).

The employee will see your request and can make adjustments and resubmit.

## Decline the expense

Click **Decline** if the expense doesn't meet your company's policy. Always add a comment explaining why—the employee needs to understand what went wrong so they can learn and resubmit if appropriate.

Common reasons to decline:

- Expense is not business-related
- Amount exceeds policy limits
- Receipt is illegible or missing
- Category is not approved for reimbursement

## Tips for reviewing expenses

- Look at the receipt details, not just the total
- If anything seems off, ask for clarification before declining
- Be consistent—apply your policy the same way for everyone
- Remember you're helping your team stay compliant
