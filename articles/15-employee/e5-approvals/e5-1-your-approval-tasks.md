# Your approval tasks

As part of your role, you might be asked to review and approve certain items in Light—like bills, expenses, or new vendors. This guide shows you where to find these tasks and how the approval process works.

## Where to find your tasks

All items waiting for your review live on your **Tasks page**. You'll see a counter badge on the Tasks icon showing how many items need your attention.

To get there, click the Tasks icon in the left sidebar (or go to `/user-tasks` in the app).

## What you might need to approve

Depending on your role, you could see:

- **Bills** — Vendor invoices waiting for your review before payment
- **Reimbursements** — Employee expense claims that need your verification
- **Vendors** — New vendors being added to your company's vendor list

Each task clearly shows what type of approval it is and key details right in the list.

## How you'll get notified

You don't have to check Light constantly. We'll let you know when you have new tasks:

- **In-app** — See the badge counter on your Tasks icon
- **Email** — Get a notification email when items are assigned to you
- **Slack** — If your company uses Slack, you'll get a notification there too

You can adjust your notification preferences in your personal settings if you'd like more or less frequent updates.

## The task counter badge

That little number on the Tasks icon is your quick heads-up. It shows exactly how many items are waiting for you right now. Click it to jump straight to your tasks.
