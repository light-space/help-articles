# Approving or declining bills

When a vendor sends an invoice to your company, it might need your approval before payment. Here's how to review and approve—or decline—a bill in Light.

## Review the bill details

When you click on a bill in your Tasks list, you'll see:

- **Vendor name** — Who sent the invoice
- **Amount** — How much is being billed
- **Invoice date and number** — For your records
- **Line items** — The services or products being charged
- **Attachments** — The original invoice file(s)

Take a moment to make sure everything looks right. Check that:

- The vendor is legitimate and you recognize them
- The amount matches what you expected
- The goods or services were actually received
- Line items match your records

## Approve the bill

Once you're confident everything is correct, click the **Approve** button.

The bill will then move to the next person in the approval chain (if there is one), or head straight to payment if you're the final approver.

## Decline the bill

If something doesn't look right, click **Decline**. You'll be asked to add a comment explaining why—this feedback is important so the bill can be corrected and resubmitted.

Common reasons to decline:

- The amount doesn't match the invoice
- We never received the goods or services
- The vendor is not approved
- The invoice is a duplicate

## After you approve

Once approved, the bill moves forward in the process. If you're the final approver, it's scheduled for payment according to your company's payment terms. If there are more approvers, it goes to them next.

You'll see the bill status change in the system, and the approver after you will be notified it's their turn.
