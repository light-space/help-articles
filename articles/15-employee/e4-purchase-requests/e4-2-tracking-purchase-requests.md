# Tracking Your Purchase Requests

Once you've filed a purchase request, you can track its status as it moves through the approval process. Light keeps you updated every step of the way.

## Finding Your Purchase Requests

To view all your submitted purchase requests:

1. Open Light
2. Go to **Purchase Orders** in the main menu
3. You'll see a list of your requests with their current status

Each request shows:
- Item or purchase description
- Amount requested
- Status (see below)
- Date submitted
- Last updated date

## Understanding Request Statuses

Your purchase request will move through several statuses:

### Pending Approval

Your request is waiting for your finance or procurement team to review it. This typically takes 1-2 business days. During this time, you might see:

- **Submitted**: Request is in the queue
- **Under Review**: Someone is actively looking at it
- **Pending More Info**: Finance team needs additional details from you (check for messages)

### Approved

Your request has been approved! Here's what happens next:

- A **Purchase Order** is automatically created
- Your finance team may contact the vendor directly to place the order
- You'll receive details about the purchase order (PO number, delivery date estimates, etc.)
- The order is being processed—no further action needed from you usually

### Declined

Your request was not approved. You'll see a reason, which might be:

- Budget constraints
- Vendor not approved
- Incomplete information
- Policy issue

You can resubmit with changes or contact your manager to discuss.

### On Hold

Your request is temporarily paused. This might happen if:

- Your finance team has questions
- Additional approvals are needed
- Budget is being reallocated
- Vendor information needs clarification

Check the notes on your request to see why it's on hold.

## Messages and Notifications

When your request status changes, you'll receive:

- **In-app notification**: A notification in Light
- **Email notification**: An email to your work email address
- **Request notes**: Any messages from your finance team explaining the status

Read these messages carefully—they often include next steps or what you need to do.

## Following Up on Delayed Requests

If your request has been pending for more than 2 business days:

1. Go to **Purchase Orders** in Light
2. Tap your request
3. Look for a **Contact Finance** or **Follow Up** button
4. Send a message to your finance team asking for an update

Or reach out to your manager or finance team directly—they're happy to help.

## After Approval: Purchase Orders

Once approved, your request becomes a **Purchase Order (PO)**. A purchase order is the official document that goes to the vendor. It includes:

- PO number
- Description of items
- Price and payment terms
- Delivery information
- Any special instructions

Your finance team handles communicating the PO to the vendor, but you might receive:

- Order confirmation emails from the vendor
- Tracking information if it's a shipment
- Invoice when the order is complete

## What If You Need to Change Your Request?

If you submitted a request but need to modify it:

- **Before approval**: You can edit details or add information while it's pending
- **After approval**: Contact your finance team if changes are needed—they may need to amend the purchase order

## Viewing Past Requests

Your complete history of purchase requests is stored in Light. You can filter by:

- Status (Approved, Declined, Pending)
- Date range
- Amount

This is helpful for:
- Budget tracking
- Vendor history
- Reviewing past approvals
