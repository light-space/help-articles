# Virtual Cards

Virtual cards are a secure way to make online purchases and recurring subscriptions without sharing your primary card number. Light lets you create expense cards and request vendor-specific cards from the [**My cards**](https://app.light.inc/user-cards) page.

## My Cards Page

The [My cards](https://app.light.inc/user-cards) page has two tabs:

- [**Transactions**](https://app.light.inc/user-cards?tab=transactions): View all your card transactions with Date, Merchant, Amount, Card, and Receipt columns. Use the **To Do** / **All** toggle to filter transactions that still need attention.
- [**Cards**](https://app.light.inc/user-cards?tab=cards): View your issued cards and create new ones.

## Creating an Expense Card

Expense cards are for general employee expenses like travel or supplies.

1. Go to [**My cards → Cards**](https://app.light.inc/user-cards?tab=cards)
2. Click **Create expense card**
3. Confirm your details:
   - **Owner**: Your name (pre-filled)
   - **Authentication phone number**: Enter your phone number for card verification
4. Click **Confirm**

Your virtual card is generated instantly and ready to use.

## Requesting a Vendor Card

Vendor cards are tied to a specific vendor and are ideal for recurring payments like subscriptions. Vendor card requests go through an approval workflow before the card is issued.

1. Click **+ Request vendor card** from the My cards page
2. Fill in the details:
   - **Owner**: Your name (pre-filled)
   - **Authentication phone number**: Phone number for card verification
   - **Vendor**: Select the vendor from the dropdown, or click **Quick-add vendor** to create a new one
   - **Card description**: A label for this card (e.g., "AWS Monthly" or "Office Supplies")
   - **Card account**: Select the card account to link
   - **Limits**: Set a monthly spending limit for this card
   - **Message to approver**: Add a note explaining why you need this card (optional)
3. Click **Request card**

Your request will be sent to your approver. Once approved, the virtual card is created and ready to use.

## Viewing Your Virtual Card Details

To see your virtual card details:

1. Go to [**My cards → Cards**](https://app.light.inc/user-cards?tab=cards)
2. Click the card you want to view
3. Reveal the card number (you may need to authenticate)
4. Copy the card number, expiration date, and CVV for your purchase

Keep these details private — treat them the same as any other payment card.

## Spending Limits on Virtual Cards

Vendor cards have a monthly spending limit set during the request process. If a transaction exceeds your limit, it will be declined. Contact your admin if you need your limit adjusted.

## Deactivating a Virtual Card

If you no longer need a virtual card, you can deactivate it from the [**My cards → Cards**](https://app.light.inc/user-cards?tab=cards) page. This stops any future charges from being processed with that card number.
