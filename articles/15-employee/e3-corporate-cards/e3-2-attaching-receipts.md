## How to Attach a Receipt

After you've made a purchase with your Light card, follow these steps:

1. Open the Light app and go to **Cards**
2. Find the transaction you just made in your recent activity
3. Tap on the transaction to view details
4. Select **Attach Receipt**
5. Choose to upload a photo of your receipt or a PDF file
6. Take a photo of the physical receipt (or upload a file you have)
7. Light's AI will automatically read and match the details
8. Review the matched information and confirm

That's it! Your receipt is now attached and your finance team can see it.

## What Light's AI Does

Once you attach a receipt, Light automatically reads the details like:

- Merchant name and location
- Transaction date
- Total amount
- Items purchased (if the receipt shows them)

In most cases, the AI matches everything perfectly. You can always adjust details if something doesn't look right before confirming.

## Multiple Receipts

If you made multiple purchases on the same day or have multiple itemized receipts for one transaction, you can attach multiple files to a single transaction.

## What Happens If You Don't Attach a Receipt

Your finance team will send you reminders if receipts are missing. Here's the timeline:

- **Within 7 days**: Light sends you a friendly reminder
- **After 14 days**: Your finance team may reach out directly
- **After 30 days**: The transaction may be flagged for follow-up

To keep things smooth and avoid delays, attach receipts within a few days of your purchase.

## Tips for Receipt Photos

- Make sure the receipt is fully visible and in focus
- Capture the entire receipt including the total amount
- Use good lighting so text is easy to read
- PDF receipts (like from email) work great too
