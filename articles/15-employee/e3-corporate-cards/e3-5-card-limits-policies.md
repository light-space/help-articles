# Card Spending Limits and Policies

Your Light card comes with a spending limit set by your company's finance team. This limit helps ensure responsible spending while giving you the flexibility to purchase what you need for work.

## Understanding Your Spending Limit

Your spending limit is the maximum amount you can spend on your Light card during a specific period (usually monthly). You can see your:

- **Total limit**: Your monthly spending ceiling
- **Amount spent**: How much you've charged so far this month
- **Remaining balance**: How much you can still spend before hitting your limit

All of this information is visible on your **Cards** page in Light.

## What Happens When You Reach Your Limit

If you try to make a purchase that would exceed your spending limit, the transaction will be **declined**. This is a built-in safety feature—your card simply won't process the charge.

**Don't panic if this happens.** Contact your finance team or manager to discuss:
- Whether the purchase is necessary
- If your limit needs adjustment
- An alternative way to complete the purchase

## Categories That May Be Blocked

Your finance team may have restricted certain spending categories on your card for compliance or policy reasons. Examples might include:

- International purchases
- High-risk merchants
- Certain types of services or products
- Specific vendors

If a category is blocked and you need an exception, reach out to your finance team to request approval.

## Requesting a Limit Increase

If you regularly hit your spending limit or have a one-time large purchase coming up, you can request an increase:

1. Open Light and go to **Cards**
2. Tap your card and select **Request Limit Increase**
3. Explain why you need more spending capacity
4. Provide details about the purchase (amount, vendor, business reason)
5. Submit for approval

Your finance team will review the request and let you know if it's approved. This usually takes 1-2 business days.

## Temporary vs. Permanent Limit Increases

- **Temporary increase**: Valid for a specific purchase or time period
- **Permanent increase**: Raises your ongoing monthly limit

Be clear about which you need when you submit your request.

## Tips for Managing Your Limit

- **Check your balance regularly**: Tap **Cards** to see how much you've spent and how much is available
- **Plan ahead**: If you know you'll make a large purchase, request an increase before you need it
- **Keep receipts ready**: Attaching receipts promptly helps your finance team process reimbursements faster if needed
- **Communicate with your manager**: Let them know about major purchases so there are no surprises

## Policy Reminders

Your Light card is for **business expenses only**. Your company's spending policies apply to everything you purchase, including:

- Purchases must be work-related
- Personal expenses cannot be charged to your company card
- Receipts are required for all transactions
- Violations of company spending policies may result in disciplinary action

## Questions About Your Limit?
