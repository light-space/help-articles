## Overview

Light's mobile app and web interface make it easy to capture receipts on the go. Upload a photo or PDF, and Light's AI extracts the spending details, categorizes the expense, and prepares it for reimbursement or ledger recording.

## What Light Extracts from Receipts

When you upload a receipt, Light's AI parsing engine captures:

- **Vendor/Merchant Name**: Who you spent money with (e.g., Starbucks, United Airlines)
- **Transaction Amount**: The total amount spent and original currency
- **Date**: When the purchase was made
- **Line Items**: Individual items purchased (if detailed on the receipt)
- **Tax Amount**: Separate capture of tax charges when available
- **Payment Method**: Type of payment (cash, card, etc.) if visible

Light stores this information and links it to your user profile for easy tracking.

## Automatic Expense Categorization

Light's AI automatically assigns expense categories based on the merchant and items purchased. The categorization system:

- Recognizes common merchant types (airlines, hotels, restaurants, office supplies, etc.)
- Analyzes line items to determine the true nature of the expense
- Applies tax codes based on category and location
- Accounts for your company's spending policies

For example, if you upload a receipt from a restaurant, Light may categorize it as "Meals and Entertainment." If you upload a receipt from an office supply store, it's categorized as "Office Supplies."

> Good to know: Light's merchant recognition includes thousands of common vendors globally, so categorization works whether you're spending locally or while traveling.

## How to Upload Receipts

### Mobile App

1. Open the Light mobile app
2. Tap the **Camera** or **Upload** icon
3. Take a photo of the receipt or select one from your phone's photos
4. Light processes the receipt automatically
5. Review the extracted data
6. Click **Save** to record the expense

### Web Interface

1. Navigate to the **Expenses** or **Receipts** section
2. Click **Upload Receipt**
3. Select a receipt image or PDF from your computer
4. Light processes and displays the extracted data
5. Review the information
6. Click **Confirm** to save

## Reviewing and Correcting Categorization

After Light extracts the receipt data:

1. Review the captured amount, date, and vendor name
2. Check the assigned expense category
3. If the category is incorrect, click to change it
4. Select the appropriate category from the list or search for it
5. Click **Save**

Light learns from your corrections, improving categorization accuracy for future receipts from the same vendor.

## Receipt Quality Tips

To ensure Light accurately captures receipt data:

- Take clear, well-lit photos of receipts
- Ensure the entire receipt is visible in the frame
- Avoid glare or shadows on the receipt
- Hold the camera steady to minimize blur
- Include the top, middle, and bottom of the receipt

Receipts with blurry text, extreme angles, or poor lighting may require manual entry.

## Tax Code Assignment

Light automatically assigns tax codes based on:

- Expense category
- Country/region of purchase
- Local tax regulations configured for your company

For example, if you upload a meal receipt from a location with specific VAT treatment, Light applies the appropriate tax code. This helps ensure accurate tax reporting and expense deductions.

## Recurring Expenses

If you frequently spend at the same merchant (e.g., regular coffee shop visits), Light remembers:

- Your preferred categorization for that vendor
- The typical amount range for your transactions
- Any tax code preferences

This makes subsequent receipts from the same vendor even faster to process.

> Tip: Batch upload receipts from a trip or week. Light processes them efficiently and groups them together, making expense review easier.
