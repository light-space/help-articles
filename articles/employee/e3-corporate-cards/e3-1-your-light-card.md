# Your Light Card

Your Light corporate card is a convenient way to pay for work expenses directly. Whether you're buying office supplies, traveling for a client meeting, or paying for software subscriptions, your Light card works just like a regular credit card—but with your company's spending oversight.

## Activating Your Card

When you first receive your physical Light card, you'll need to activate it before you can use it. Open the Light app, go to **Cards**, and follow the activation steps. You'll verify your card details and set up any additional security preferences.

## Viewing Your Card Details

Your full card number, expiration date, and CVV are stored securely in the Light app. You can find this information anytime by:

1. Going to **Cards** in the app
2. Tapping on your active card
3. Revealing the full card number (you may need to authenticate)

Keep your card number private and never share it outside of work purchases.

## Checking Your Spending Limit

Your spending limit is set by your finance team and shows the maximum amount you can spend on your card. You can see your:

- Total spending limit
- Amount spent so far this month
- Remaining available balance

All of this is visible on your **Cards** page. If you're getting close to your limit, you'll see a warning in the app.

## Viewing Recent Transactions

Every purchase you make appears on your Light card immediately. You can see:

- Transaction date and time
- Merchant name and location
- Amount spent
- Receipt status (whether a receipt has been attached)

Browse your recent transactions anytime by tapping **Cards** → your card → **Transactions**. This helps you stay on top of your spending and prepare receipts for your finance team.

## What Happens Next

After you make a purchase, you'll need to attach a receipt to the transaction. This helps your company track spending and ensures accuracy in the books.
