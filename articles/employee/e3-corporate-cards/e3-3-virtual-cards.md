# Virtual Cards

Virtual cards are a secure way to make online purchases and recurring subscriptions without sharing your physical card number. Light lets you create and manage multiple virtual cards with custom spending limits.

## What's a Virtual Card?

A virtual card is a temporary or permanent card number generated by Light specifically for online purchases. Instead of entering your actual card number on a website, you use a unique virtual card number. This protects your real card information and helps you control spending for specific subscriptions or vendors.

## Requesting a Virtual Card

To create a new virtual card:

1. Open Light and go to **Cards**
2. Tap **+ Create Virtual Card**
3. Choose a card type:
   - **Single-use**: For one-time online purchases (more secure)
   - **Recurring**: For subscriptions and regular vendors (more convenient)
4. Set a spending limit for this card (optional, but recommended)
5. Give it a nickname so you remember what it's for (e.g., "AWS Account" or "Office Supplies")
6. Confirm and create

Your virtual card number generates instantly and you can start using it right away.

## Viewing Your Virtual Card Number

To see your virtual card details:

1. Go to **Cards** in Light
2. Tap the virtual card you want to use
3. Reveal the card number (you may need to authenticate)
4. Copy the number, expiration date, and CVV to use for your purchase

Keep these details private, just like your physical card.

## Single-Use vs. Recurring Virtual Cards

**Single-use cards** are automatically deactivated after one purchase, making them extra secure for one-time online purchases or when you're buying from a vendor you've never used before.

**Recurring cards** stay active so you can use them multiple times, perfect for subscription services (software, cloud storage, streaming platforms) or vendors you buy from regularly.

## Spending Limits on Virtual Cards

When you create a virtual card, you can set a maximum spending limit. For example, you might set a $50/month limit on a subscription service card or $500 limit on a software vendor card. If someone gets your virtual card number, they can't spend more than your limit.

## Deactivating a Virtual Card

If you no longer need a virtual card, you can deactivate it anytime from the **Cards** page. This stops any future charges from being processed with that card number.
