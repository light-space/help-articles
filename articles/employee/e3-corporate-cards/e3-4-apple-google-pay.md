## What You Should Know

- **Same card, same limits**: Using Apple Pay or Google Pay doesn't change your spending limit or how your company tracks expenses
- **Receipts still required**: After making a payment, you still need to attach receipts in Light for your finance team
- **Contactless payments**: Both Apple Pay and Google Pay use secure contactless technology—your actual card number isn't shared with the merchant
- **Mobile security**: Your payment information is protected by your phone's security (Face ID, Touch ID, or PIN)

## Removing from Apple Pay or Google Pay

If you need to remove your Light card from Apple Pay or Google Pay:

1. Go to your device's wallet or payment settings
2. Find your Light card
3. Select **Remove Card**

You can always re-add it later through the Light app.
