# Understanding Expense Policies

Your company sets rules about what expenses can be reimbursed, how much you can spend, and what documentation you need. Light helps you follow these policies so your expenses get approved faster.

## What Are Expense Policies?

Expense policies are your company's guidelines for spending. They typically cover:

- **What's reimbursable**: Which types of expenses the company will pay back (e.g., travel, meals, office supplies)
- **Spending limits**: Maximum amounts per category or per transaction (e.g., $50 max per meal, $2,000 max per week)
- **Documentation requirements**: Whether you need receipts, and what kind (digital, paper, email)
- **Approval chains**: Who needs to approve what (your manager, finance team, etc.)
- **Special rules**: Restrictions for certain types of expenses (e.g., alcohol only for client entertainment, not personal meals)

## Checking Your Company's Policies

Your admin sets up policies in Light. To view them:

1. Log into Light
2. Go to **Expenses** (/expenses)
3. Look for a **"Company Policies"** or **"Policy Details"** link (usually on the Expenses page or in help)
4. You'll see:
   - All reimbursable categories
   - Spending limits for each
   - Receipt requirements
   - Any special rules

**Can't find the policies?** Ask your manager or admin. They can send you a copy or point you to where they're documented.

## How Light Helps You Stay Compliant

Before you submit an expense, Light checks it against your company's policies. If something doesn't match:

**Light flags it in yellow or red:**
- **Yellow flag**: Warning—Light detected a potential issue, but you can still submit (e.g., it's close to the limit)
- **Red flag**: Policy violation—Light won't let you submit until you fix it (e.g., it exceeds the limit or missing receipt)

**Common policy violations:**
- Amount exceeds the limit for that category
- Category not approved by your company
- Missing receipt when one is required
- Alcohol on a personal meal (only allowed for client entertainment)
- International expense when not pre-approved

## What Happens If You Violate a Policy?

**Before you submit**: Light stops you and explains the issue. You can either:
- **Fix it** (change the amount or category)
- **Request an exception** (ask for approval even though it violates policy)
- **Cancel and try again**

**If you request an exception**: Your manager or admin gets a notification that you're asking for special approval. They can approve it anyway or ask you to change it. This might take an extra day or two.

**After you submit (if a violation slips through)**: Your manager or finance team might reject it and ask you to resubmit correctly. It's faster to follow policies the first time.

## Special Approval for Big Expenses

Some companies require extra approval for large expenses. If your expense is above a certain threshold:
1. Light will flag it
2. You can still submit
3. It goes to your manager first, then to a finance team member for final approval
4. This might add a day or two to the approval process

## Personal Expenses & Non-Reimbursable Items

Your company won't reimburse personal expenses. If you accidentally submit one, your manager will reject it. Common non-reimbursable expenses include:
- Groceries for personal use
- Gym memberships
- Personal entertainment
- Commuting costs (unless your company has a specific travel policy)

When in doubt, ask your manager before you submit.

## Different Policies for Different Roles

Some companies have different policies based on your job or level:
- **Executives** might have higher spending limits
- **Sales team** might have different meal and entertainment rules
- **Remote workers** might have different policies than office-based teams

Light will apply the right policy to your account automatically. You'll only see limits and categories that apply to you.

## Policy Updates

Your admin might update policies from time to time (e.g., raising limits during budget season, adding new categories). When policies change:
- Light will notify you in the app
- Your old expenses won't be affected
- New submissions will follow the new policies

## Tips for Staying Compliant

- **Read your company's policies first**: Know what's OK to expense before you spend
- **Check expense categories**: Make sure you're using the right category for your purchase
- **Keep good receipts**: Most policies require them, and Light needs them to read the details
- **Submit soon after purchase**: Expenses are easier to document while details are fresh
- **When in doubt, ask**: If you're not sure if something's reimbursable, ask your manager before you submit

## Questions About a Policy?

If a policy doesn't make sense or seems unclear:
1. Log into Light and find the specific policy that's confusing
2. Ask your manager or admin what it means
3. If you think it's a mistake, contact your finance team
