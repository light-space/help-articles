# Submitting Expenses via Email

Don't have Light open? No problem. You can submit expenses by forwarding your receipt to Light's expense email address. Light will process it and you'll see it in the app.

## How It Works

Light monitors a dedicated email address. You send your receipt, Light's AI reads it, and the expense shows up in your Light account automatically.

## Step 1: Get Your Company's Expense Email Address

Your admin will give you Light's expense email address (it looks something like **expenses@light.yourcompany.com** or similar). If you don't have it, ask your admin or check your company's internal documentation.

## Step 2: Forward or Attach Your Receipt

1. Find your receipt email (from the merchant) or take a screenshot/photo of it
2. Compose a new email to Light's expense address
3. **Attach the receipt** as an image (JPG, PNG) or PDF
4. **In the email body**, add any context (optional):
   - What the expense was for (e.g., "Client dinner in NYC")
   - Who you were with (if relevant)
   - Any project or cost center it should be assigned to
5. Send the email

## Step 3: Review in Light

Within a few minutes, Light's AI processes your receipt and the expense appears in your Light account under Expenses (/expenses). You'll see:
- The extracted merchant name
- Amount
- Date
- AI-suggested category

## Step 4: Confirm & Submit

1. Log into Light and go to **Expenses**
2. Find the expense that came in via email (it might say "Draft" or "Pending Review")
3. Review the details the AI extracted
4. Make any edits if needed (fix the category, add a description, etc.)
5. Click **"Submit for Approval"**
6. Your manager gets notified and can approve it

## Why Use This Method

- **No app needed**: Works from your email client on any device
- **Flexible**: Send receipts throughout the day, process them when you have time
- **Digital receipts**: Works with email receipts from online purchases too

## Pro Tips

- **Include context in the email**: A note like "Q1 conference registration" helps you remember what it was for later
- **Use clear subject lines**: "Expense: Office Supplies" helps you organize
- **Attach one receipt per email**: It's easier for Light to process one receipt at a time

## Troubleshooting

**"I don't know the expense email address"**
Ask your admin for the Light expense email address. It's usually in a setup guide or company resource.

**"My expense hasn't appeared yet"**
Wait a few minutes for Light to process it. If it still doesn't show up after 10 minutes, check that you:
- Sent it to the correct email address
- Attached a readable receipt image or PDF
- Included your account in the recipient field

**"Light got the details wrong"**
No problem. When you see it in Light, click on it and edit the details before you submit. You're never locked into what the AI reads.

**"I sent it but can't find it"**
Log into Light and go to **Expenses** (/expenses). Scroll through your list—it might be marked as a draft. If you still can't find it, contact your admin.
