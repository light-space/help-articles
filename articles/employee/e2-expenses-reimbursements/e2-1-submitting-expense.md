# Submitting an Expense for Reimbursement

Submitting an expense in Light is fast and simple. Just snap a photo of your receipt, and Light's AI does the heavy lifting. Here's how.

[Open in Light →](https://app.light.inc/expenses)

## Step 1: Navigate to Expenses

Log into Light and click **Expenses** in the sidebar. You'll see all your past expenses and a button to submit a new one.

## Step 2: Start a New Expense

Click the **"+ New Expense"** or **"Submit Expense"** button. Light will take you to the submission form.

## Step 3: Attach Your Receipt

This is where Light's AI comes in. You can:
- **Take a photo** of your receipt (phone camera works great)
- **Upload a PDF** or image file from your computer
- **Paste an image** from your clipboard

The better the photo, the better Light's AI can read it. Make sure the receipt is well-lit and text is readable.

## Step 4: Let AI Fill in the Details

Light's AI automatically reads your receipt and fills in:
- **Merchant Name** (the place you bought from)
- **Amount** (total spent)
- **Date** (when you made the purchase)
- **Category** (Office Supplies, Travel, Meals, etc.)

Review what the AI filled in. If anything looks wrong, click to edit it and correct it manually.

## Step 5: Add Details & Context

1. **Description**: Add a note about why you bought this (e.g., "Office supplies for Q1 planning meeting")
2. **Category**: If Light guessed wrong, pick the correct category from the dropdown
3. **Cost Center** (if your company uses them): Assign this expense to a project or department
4. **Attendees** (if this was a meal with team members): Add who was present

## Step 6: Check Your Policy Compliance

Before you hit submit, Light checks your company's expense policies. If your expense violates a policy (e.g., it's over the limit for that category, or receipts are required), Light will flag it in red and explain what's wrong. You can:
- **Fix it** if it's an error
- **Request an exception** if you think it should be approved anyway
- **Go back** and try again with a different expense

## Step 7: Submit

Click **"Submit for Approval"**. Your manager (or whoever approves expenses on your team) will get notified. You'll see your expense status change to "Submitted" in your Expenses list.

## What Happens Next

Once submitted, your expense goes to your manager for approval. Check your Expenses page to track the status. Learn more in [Tracking Your Reimbursement Status](e2-6-tracking-reimbursement.md).

## Pro Tips

- **Attach a good photo**: Clear, straight-on photos help Light's AI read your receipt faster
- **Submit soon after purchase**: Expenses are easier to categorize and approve while they're fresh
- **Check policies ahead of time**: Review your company's policies so you know what's reimbursable (see [Understanding Expense Policies](e2-7-expense-policies.md))
- **Use categories wisely**: The right category helps your manager understand the expense faster

## Troubleshooting

**"Light can't read my receipt"**
Try taking another photo in better lighting, or upload a digital receipt from your email if you have one. You can also type in the details manually.

**"I submitted by mistake"**
If your expense is still "Submitted" (not approved yet), you can click it and edit or delete it. Once approved, contact your manager or admin to handle changes.
