# Approving or declining vendors

When someone proposes a new vendor to work with, it typically needs approval before they can be added to your company's vendor list. Here's how to review and approve—or decline—a vendor.

## Review the vendor details

Click on the vendor in your Tasks list. You'll see key information:

- **Vendor name** — Company name
- **Country** — Where the vendor is based
- **Contact information** — Phone, email, address
- **Banking details** — Account info for payments
- **Tax ID or business number** — Official business identifier
- **Notes** — Any other relevant info from the person proposing them

Take time to review each section carefully.

## Approve the vendor

If the vendor looks legitimate and you're comfortable working with them, click **Approve**. They'll be added to your company's approved vendor list and can start receiving payments.

Before approving, consider:

- Is the vendor from a country your company wants to work with?
- Does the banking information look correct?
- Do you recognize the business as legitimate?
- Are there any red flags in the contact or tax information?

## Decline the vendor

If something doesn't feel right, click **Decline** and add a comment explaining why. The person who proposed the vendor will see your feedback.

Common reasons to decline:

- Vendor is in a country your company doesn't approve
- Banking information looks suspicious
- Tax ID doesn't match or seems invalid
- You have concerns about the legitimacy of the business

## Why vendor approval matters

Vendor approval is a key part of keeping your company safe and compliant:

- **Compliance** — You make sure vendors meet your company's standards and regulations
- **Fraud prevention** — You catch suspicious vendors before they're added to your system
- **Financial control** — You have visibility into who's being paid and why
- **Consistency** — All vendors go through the same review process

Your review helps protect your company's finances and reputation.
