## What You Can Do in Light

**Submit Expenses & Get Reimbursed**
Traveled for work? Bought office supplies? Submit your expense in Light with a photo of your receipt. Our AI reads the receipt automatically, you approve the details, and you get reimbursed—no manual data entry needed.

**Manage Your Card**
If your company provides you with a Light card, you can manage it right here. Check your balance, view transactions, freeze your card if needed, and get instant notifications when you spend.

**Approve Spending (if you're a manager)**
If team members report to you, you can review and approve their expenses, purchase requests, and card transactions—all from one place.

**Request Company Purchases**
Need to buy something for work? Request it through Light, and get clarity on whether it's approved before you spend.
