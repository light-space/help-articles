# Common issues for employees

Running into a problem in Light? Here are some of the most common issues and how to fix them yourself.

## Can't log in

**Try these steps:**

1. Check that you're using your company email address
2. If your company uses single sign-on (SSO), make sure you're clicking the SSO login button, not entering a password
3. Try resetting your password—click "Forgot password?" on the login page and follow the link sent to your email
4. Make sure you're going to the correct URL: `app.light.inc`
5. Clear your browser cookies and try again

If these don't work, reach out to your company's IT or finance team to confirm your account is set up.

## Receipt upload fails

**This usually means one of two things:**

- **File is too large** — Try compressing the image or converting it to a smaller format
- **Wrong file format** — Light accepts JPG, PNG, and PDF. If you have another format, convert it first

**Quick fix:** Try uploading a JPG version of your receipt instead. JPGs are usually smaller and always work.

## Card transaction not showing

**Don't worry—this is normal.** Card transactions can take 1-2 days to appear in Light after you swipe or tap.

If it's been more than 2 days and you still don't see it, check that:
- The transaction went through (check your card issuer's app)
- You're looking in the right time period
- The amount matches what you remember

Still stuck? Contact your finance team.

## Expense rejected

**Your expense was sent back.** Look at the comment the approver left—it explains what went wrong.

Common reasons:

- Receipt is blurry or doesn't show the amount
- Expense doesn't match your company policy
- Description is missing or too vague
- Category was wrong

**Next steps:** Fix the issue and resubmit. If you're not sure what's wrong, ask your approver directly.

## Approval task missing

**Can't find a task you know was assigned to you?**

1. Go to your Tasks page
2. Check the filters at the top—you might have filtered out the task type you're looking for
3. Try removing filters or clearing the search box
4. Refresh the page

If you still can't find it, it may have already been approved by someone else or reassigned.
