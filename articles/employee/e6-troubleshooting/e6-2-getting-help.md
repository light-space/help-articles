# Getting help

Something's not working, or you have a question about Light? Here's how to get answers.

## Contact your finance team first

Your company's finance or accounting team knows your setup best. They can often answer questions about:

- Company policy and approval workflows
- How expenses should be categorized
- Who to contact for specific issues
- Your company's payment schedule or other processes

Check your internal directory or Slack to find who to reach out to. They're usually happy to help.

## Contact Light support

If your finance team can't solve it, or if it's a technical issue with the app itself, reach out to Light support.

**Email:** `support@light.inc`

**Response time:** We typically respond within 24 hours on weekdays.

## What to include in your report

When you contact Light support, help us help you faster by including:

- **What you were trying to do** — Be specific ("I tried to upload a receipt for an expense" instead of "upload isn't working")
- **What happened** — Describe the error or unexpected behavior
- **Your email address** — So we can look up your account
- **Screenshots** — If possible, a screenshot of the issue is super helpful
- **Browser and device** — What device and browser are you using? (e.g., "Chrome on Mac" or "Safari on iPhone")
- **When it happened** — Date and time, and whether it's still happening

The more detail you give, the faster we can track down the problem.

## In-app help and chat

Look for the help icon (usually a question mark) in the bottom right corner of Light. You can:

- Search our help articles
- Chat with our support team in real-time (if available in your region)
- Browse frequently asked questions

## Still having trouble?

If you can't reach your finance team and support is taking longer than expected, try:

- **Clearing your cache** — Sometimes Light works better after a fresh start
- **Using a different browser** — See if the issue happens in Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.
- **Checking your internet connection** — A slow or unstable connection can cause weird behavior
- **Logging out and back in** — A fresh session often clears things up
