# Filing a Purchase Request

A purchase request lets you get approval from your finance or procurement team before making a large purchase or buying from a new vendor. It's a simple process that protects both you and your company.

## When to File a Purchase Request

You should file a purchase request when:

- You need approval before making a purchase
- Your purchase exceeds your card's spending limit
- You're buying from a new or unfamiliar vendor
- Your company requires pre-approval for certain purchases
- You need to order items in bulk or at high cost

Check with your manager if you're unsure whether you need a purchase request.

## How to File a Purchase Request

Follow these steps to submit a purchase request:

1. Open Light and navigate to **Purchase Orders** in the main menu
2. Tap **+ New Purchase Request**
3. Fill in the following details:

**What you're buying:**
- Item name or description
- Quantity
- Unit price (if known)
- Estimated total amount

**Vendor information:**
- Vendor or company name
- Contact information (email or phone)
- Any vendor account info you have

**Business details:**
- What is this purchase for? (brief description)
- Which department or project does it belong to?
- Who is this purchase for?

**Attachments (optional but helpful):**
- Quotes from the vendor
- Pricing documents
- Specifications or product links
- Any other relevant documentation

4. Review all information for accuracy
5. Tap **Submit for Approval**

Your request is now in the queue for your finance team to review.

## What Vendors Need to Know

When possible, include quotes from your vendor in the purchase request. This helps your finance team:

- Verify pricing
- Compare multiple vendors if needed
- Process the order faster once approved
- Set up payment terms

Most vendors can email you a quote or price estimate in minutes—it makes the approval process smoother.

## Estimated Amount

If you don't know the exact price, provide your best estimate. Your finance team can adjust the amount when they process the order. Accuracy helps prevent delays, so round up slightly if you're unsure.

## Adding More Details

If you need to add more information after submitting, you can:

1. Go to **Purchase Orders**
2. Find your pending request
3. Tap **Add Details** or **Add Attachment**
4. Update the information

## Tips for Fast Approval

Reach out to your manager or finance team to discuss next steps and resubmit if needed.
