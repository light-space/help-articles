## Understanding notifications in Light

Light notifies you about important events related to your work, such as tasks requiring your attention, approval requests, and updates to documents you're involved with. Notifications appear within the Light application as part of your workflow.

## Slack integration

Light integrates with Slack to deliver notifications to your team's Slack workspace. To configure the Slack integration:

1. Go to **Settings (gear icon) → Integrations**
2. Find the **Slack** integration
3. Follow the setup instructions to connect your Slack workspace
4. Once connected, Light can send notifications to designated Slack channels

> Good to know: The Integrations page also includes connections for **HubSpot** and **Banks**, but Slack is the primary channel for team notifications.

## Profile settings

Your profile contains personal settings that affect how you interact with Light, but notification-specific preferences are managed through integrations rather than the profile page:

1. Go to **Settings (gear icon) → Profile**
2. The profile page includes tabs for:
   - **Contact Information**: Your personal contact details
   - **User settings**: General user preferences
   - **Reimbursement details**: Your reimbursement configuration
   - **Organization details**: Information about your organization

## Best practices

- Connect the Slack integration to keep your team informed of important events in real time
- Check the Integrations page periodically to ensure your connections remain active
- Keep your profile contact information up to date so Light can reach you when needed
