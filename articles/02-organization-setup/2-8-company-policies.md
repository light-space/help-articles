## What are company policies?

Company policies in Light are formal documents that communicate your organization's rules, procedures, and expectations to employees. Policies typically cover expense policies, procurement procedures, code of conduct, compliance requirements, and other governance topics. Policies ensure consistency and accountability across your organization.

> Good to know: Light allows you to assign policies to specific company entities and track employee acknowledgment of policy acceptance.

## Creating a new policy

1. Navigate to **Settings (gear icon) → Guardrails > Policies**
2. Click **+ Create policy**
3. Enter the **Policy Title** (e.g., "Expense Policy", "Travel Policy", "Procurement Guidelines")
4. Select the **Company Entities** this policy applies to
5. Choose how to provide content:
   - **Upload Document**: Upload a PDF, Word, or other document file
   - **Paste Content**: Paste policy text directly into Light
6. If uploading, click **Upload File** and select your document
7. If pasting, click **Paste Content** and enter the policy text
8. Add optional **Description** or **Summary** for quick reference
9. Click **Create Policy**

Light stores the policy and makes it available to your team based on entity assignment.

## Editing policies

To update an existing policy:

1. Go to **Settings (gear icon) → Guardrails > Policies**
2. Find the policy in the list
3. Click **Edit**
4. Update:
   - Policy title
   - Assigned entities
   - Policy content
   - Description
5. Increment the **Version Number** if this is a significant update
6. Click **Save Changes**

When a policy is updated, team members who've already acknowledged it may need to acknowledge the new version depending on your policy settings.

## Policy assignment to entities

Policies can be assigned to multiple entities to specify where they apply:

1. When creating or editing a policy, go to the **Entities** section
2. Check the boxes for entities that should follow this policy
3. Leave unchecked for entities where the policy doesn't apply
4. Click **Save**

This approach allows different policies for different regions, subsidiaries, or divisions.

## Generating preview links

Open a policy and click Generate Preview Link. Set an expiration date and optionally add a section title. Light creates a secure, time-limited URL that you can share via email. Recipients view content without Light access, and the link expires automatically on the specified date.

## Tracking policy acceptance

When creating or editing a policy, toggle Require Acknowledgment and set an optional deadline. Light tracks acknowledgment dates, users, policy versions, and overdue acknowledgments.

## Viewing policy acknowledgments

To check which employees have acknowledged a policy:

1. Open the policy
2. Click **Acknowledgments**
3. Light displays:
   - Employee name
   - Acknowledgment status (Acknowledged, Pending, Overdue)
   - Date acknowledged
   - Deadline (if set)
4. Filter by status to focus on pending or overdue acknowledgments
5. Export the list for compliance documentation

## Policy distribution and notifications

Notify team members about new or updated policies:

1. After creating or updating a policy, click **Notify Users**
2. Select **Notification Type**:
   - **Email**: Send notification email with preview link
   - **In-App**: Display notification in Light dashboard
   - **Both**: Send email and in-app notifications
3. Customize the **Notification Message** if desired
4. Select **Recipients**:
   - All users in assigned entities
   - Specific user groups
   - Individual users
5. Click **Send Notifications**

Recipients receive the notification with a link to view and acknowledge the policy.

## Policy versioning

Light maintains version history for audit and compliance. Each update increments the version number, and previous versions remain viewable in Version History. Versions show the version number, date, who updated it, and changes from the previous version.

## Organizing policies

Use clear naming for categories like Procurement, Expense, Compliance, Operational, and Finance policies. Consider creating a policy index to help users navigate.

## Retiring policies

When a policy is no longer in effect, open it and click Archive Policy. It becomes archived for historical records and no longer appears in active lists, though historical acknowledgments remain in the audit trail for compliance.

## Policy content and compliance

Write policies with clear language, specific examples, key term definitions, contact information, and effective dates. Light maintains audit trails tracking who created/updated policies, all acknowledgments with timestamps, distribution dates, and acknowledgment rates. For compliance documentation, navigate to **Planning & Reports → Reports** and select a Compliance report to export acknowledgment data and version history.

## Best practices

Create policies for areas requiring consistent behavior. Use consistent naming conventions and review annually. Assign clear ownership, require acknowledgment for compliance policies, and use preview links for external sharing. Maintain version control, archive obsolete policies, and document business rationale for each.
