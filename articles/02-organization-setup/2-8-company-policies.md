## What are company policies?

Company policies in Light are documents that communicate your organization's rules, procedures, and expectations. Policies can cover expense guidelines, procurement procedures, compliance requirements, and other governance topics. Policies can be assigned to specific entities so different parts of your organization follow the appropriate rules.

## Navigating the Policy page

1. Go to [**Settings (gear icon) → Policy**](https://app.light.inc/settings/policies) in the sidebar
2. The page displays all policies with columns for **Title**, **Entities**, **Last edited**, and **Edited by**
3. Use the **+ Create policy** button to add a new policy
4. Use the **Upload** button to upload an existing policy document

## Creating a policy

1. Navigate to [**Settings (gear icon) → Policy**](https://app.light.inc/settings/policies)
2. Click **+ Create policy**
3. Fill in the policy details:
   - **Entities**: Select the company entities this policy applies to
   - **Title**: Enter a descriptive policy title (e.g., "Expense Policy", "Travel Policy")
   - **Content**: Use the rich text editor to write the policy content. The editor supports formatting such as headings, bold, italic, lists, and other standard text formatting options
4. Click **Save**

## Uploading a policy

You can upload an existing policy document instead of creating one from scratch:

1. Navigate to [**Settings (gear icon) → Policy**](https://app.light.inc/settings/policies)
2. Click **Upload**
3. Select a document file from your computer
4. Light processes the uploaded document

> Good to know: The Upload button includes an AI icon, indicating that Light can assist with processing uploaded policy documents.

## Viewing a policy

1. Click on a policy in the list to open its detail view
2. The detail view shows:
   - The policy title
   - Assigned entities
   - Full policy content
   - **Last edited by** information showing who last modified the policy
3. Click **Edit** in the top-right corner to make changes

## Editing a policy

1. Open the policy by clicking on it in the list
2. Click **Edit**
3. Update the policy fields:
   - **Entities**: Change which entities the policy applies to
   - **Title**: Update the policy title
   - **Content**: Modify the policy text using the rich text editor
4. Click **Save**

## Assigning policies to entities

Policies can be scoped to specific entities:

1. When creating or editing a policy, click the **Entities** dropdown
2. Select the entities this policy should apply to
3. Save the policy

This allows different subsidiaries, regions, or divisions to have their own relevant policies.

## Best practices

- Use clear, descriptive titles that indicate the policy's purpose
- Assign policies to the correct entities to keep them relevant
- Write policy content with clear language and specific guidelines
- Review policies periodically to ensure they remain current
- Use the rich text editor's formatting options to make policies easy to read
