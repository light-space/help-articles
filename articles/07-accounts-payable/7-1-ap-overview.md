# Accounts Payable Overview

Light's Accounts Payable (AP) covers the bill-to-payment workflow: capturing vendor bills, routing them for approval, scheduling and releasing payments, and tracking what's been paid.

## Bills List — Tabs

The Bills page is organised into five tabs:

| Tab | Contains |
|---|---|
| **Inbox** | Newly ingested bills awaiting review/approval |
| **Approving** | Bills currently in approval flow |
| **Scheduled** | Bills approved and ready for / in payment |
| **Paid** | Fully paid bills |
| **Discarded** | Declined or cancelled bills |

## Bill Lifecycle

A bill progresses through approval-driven states. Common ones you'll see in the UI:

| State | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `IN_DRAFT` | Draft, editable |
| `APPROVAL_REQUESTED` | Sent for approval |
| `APPROVAL_PENDING` | Awaiting approver action |
| `DECLINED` | Rejected by an approver |
| `APPROVED_ACCOUNTING_ENTRY_PENDING` | Approved; finalising accounting entry |
| `READY_FOR_PAYMENT_RELEASE` | Ready to release the payment |
| `PENDING_PAYMENT_APPROVAL` | Payment batch awaiting approval |
| `PAYMENT_PAUSED` | Payment paused |
| `SCHEDULED` | Payment scheduled for a future date |
| `PAYMENT_PENDING` | Payment initiated |
| `PARTIALLY_PAID` | Partial payment matched |
| `UNPAID` | Posted to GL but not yet paid |
| `PAID` | Fully paid |
| `COMPLETED` | Settled |
| `CANCELLED` | Cancelled |
| `DUPLICATED` | Detected as a duplicate |
